Sometimes you find yourself wanting to use a **color palette that is not available in TailwindCSS**. You can obviously just create one by hand and figure out the values but if you're like me, you'd rather automate this process.

This is why I developed a handy tool that takes to colors and interpolates the values, generating the exact steps for a common TailwindCSS palette. You can try it out [here](https://bagr-ui.vercel.app/generator).

One general use case is to just pick a **very light color** and a **very dark color** of similar hue and let the computer do the rest. Copy the output generated in the [BagrUI generator](https://bagr-ui.vercel.app/generator) and paste it in your `tailwind.config.js` file.

This is especially useful when you're working with a fancy design system, like having a **primary, secondary or tertiary** color palette. Here are is an example of a set of colors you can use as primary color palette:

```js
extend: {
  colors: {
    primary: {
      DEFAULT: '#3b82f6',
      50: '#eff6ff',
      100: '#dbeafe',
      200: '#bfdbfe',
      300: '#93c5fd',
      400: '#60a5fa',
      500: '#3b82f6',
      600: '#2563eb',
      700: '#1d4ed8',
      800: '#1e40af',
      900: '#1e3a8a',
      950: '#172554',
    }
  },
}
```

> Notice how the `DEFAULT` key is used to define the main color of the palette. Normally you could set one of the middle values as the default color, but in this example I went with a custom value.

Here is another great example of a useful color palette that is sometimes missing when working with a dark mode. The **navy color palette**:

```js
extend: {
  colors: {
    primary: {
    navy: {
      50: '#f9fafa',
      100: '#f3f4f5',
      200: '#e4e5e9',
      300: '#d2d4d9',
      400: '#9ea2ac',
      500: '#6e717d',
      600: '#4e535f',
      700: '#3b404b',
      800: '#232830',
      900: '#141821',
      950: '#0b0e18',
    },
  },
}
```
