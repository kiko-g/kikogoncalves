I'm thrilled to share my latest creation, the **Bagger Flow Theme** for Visual Studio Code. This theme offers a modern, colorful, and slick interface designed to enhance your coding experience with a clean and minimal dark aesthetic. Inspired by Tailwind Moon and GitHub Dark Mode, it ensures an eye-pleasing workspace for extended coding sessions.

## Installation

To install, launch VS Code Quick Open (`Ctrl+P`), paste the following command:

```
ext install kikogoncalves.bagger-flow
```

Press enter when the prompt is ready. Check it out on the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kikogoncalves.bagger-flow). I'm committed to continuously improving this theme, so your feedback is invaluable. Happy coding!

## Key Features

- **Enhanced Syntax Highlighting**: Carefully refined colors to distinguish syntax elements clearly.
- **Frequent Updates**: Regularly updated with community feedback to ensure the best experience.
- **Wide Language Support**: Initial support includes HTML, CSS, JS/TS, JSX/TSX, and Ruby, with plans to expand further.
